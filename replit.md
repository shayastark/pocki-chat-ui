## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The application features a panda-themed design with calm green and bamboo accents, utilizing Tailwind CSS for styling. Animations are gentle and smooth, including fade-in, slide-up, and pulse effects.

**Branding:**
- **Logo:** Custom Pocki logo image (`/public/pocki-logo.jpg`) featuring a panda holding a wallet on a green background
- **Logo Usage:** Used throughout the app including landing page, chat header, loading states, and error states
- **Logo Styling:** Rounded corners with shadow effects for a modern, friendly appearance

### Technical Implementations
The core application is built with Next.js 14 (App Router), React, and TypeScript.
- **Authentication:** Privy is used for secure wallet, email, and social logins.
- **Messaging:** XMTP Browser SDK (v5.0.1) provides real-time, secure messaging.
- **Web3:** Wagmi and Viem are integrated for Ethereum interactions, specifically targeting the Base network (chainId: 8453).
- **State Management:** TanStack Query handles data fetching and caching.

### Feature Specifications
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Landing page with Privy authentication and protected chat routes.
- **XMTP Integration:** XMTP client initialization with auto-reconnection (up to 6 retries), automatic revocation of old XMTP installations to prevent limit issues, real-time message streaming, and typing indicators from the AI agent.
- **Message Management:** Message list display, manual refresh button for on-demand message syncing, and auto-sync after sending messages to fetch agent responses.
- **Transaction Handling:** Confirmation modal and execution of transactions on the Base network.
- **User Feedback:** Panda emoji read status, loading skeletons, and animations.
- **Robustness:** Comprehensive error boundaries are implemented throughout the application.

### System Design Choices
- **Provider Hierarchy:** `PrivyProvider` (authentication), `QueryClientProvider` (data fetching), `WagmiProvider` (Ethereum interactions), and `XMTPProvider` (messaging client) are nested to ensure proper context flow.
- **XMTP Browser SDK v5.0.1:** Requires specific CORS headers (`Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: credentialless`, `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`), operates in a single tab due to OPFS limitations, and uses WebAssembly for performance.
- **Agent Interaction:** The application communicates with an AI agent that requires specific XMTP Agent SDK configurations, including `ReplyCodec` registration, event listeners for incoming text messages, and an actively running service with a matching inbox ID.
- **Deployment:** Optimized for Autoscale deployment on Replit, suitable for stateless web UI and supporting WebSockets for XMTP streaming. Builds are optimized with source maps and CSS optimization disabled for faster deployments.

## External Dependencies
- **Privy:** Authentication service (`@privy-io/react-auth`, `@privy-io/wagmi`).
- **XMTP:** Decentralized messaging protocol (`@xmtp/xmtp-js`, `@xmtp/browser-sdk`).
- **Wagmi:** React Hooks for Ethereum (`wagmi`).
- **Viem:** TypeScript interface for Ethereum (`viem`).
- **TanStack Query:** Data fetching library (`@tanstack/react-query`).
- **Next.js:** Web framework.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework.

## Recent Updates

### Oct 25, 2025 - Performance Optimizations
- **Optimized TransactionModal rendering** - Reduced React re-renders during multi-call transactions
  - Changed status rendering to derive from `currentCallIndex` and `isExecuting` instead of intermediate state updates
  - Previously: 2 state updates per call (hash received + confirmed) = 4 updates for 2-call swaps
  - Now: 1 state update per call (only when confirmed) = 2 updates for 2-call swaps
  - Shows combined "‚è≥ Signing & Confirming..." label during transaction execution
  - Maintains good UX while reducing unnecessary component re-renders by 50%
  - Applied to both XMTP and legacy transaction formats for consistency
- **Added setTimeout cleanup in useXMTP hook** - Prevents memory leaks on component unmount
  - Added `autoSyncTimeoutRef` to track auto-sync timeout ID
  - Clears existing timeout before setting new one (prevents timeout buildup from rapid message sends)
  - Added useEffect cleanup to cancel timeout when component unmounts
  - Eliminates risk of dangling timers calling state updates after unmount

### Oct 25, 2025 - XMTP Rate Limit Fix
- **Reduced XMTP API calls to prevent rate limiting** - Improved message reliability
  - Removed 10-second background sync that was causing HTTP 429 rate limit errors on `query_group_messages`
  - Removed agent inbox verification call that was hitting rate-limited `get_identity_updates_v2` endpoint
  - Consolidated multiple `syncAll()` calls during client initialization into single sync operation
  - Removed redundant conversation-specific sync after global sync
  - Relies on real-time message stream for incoming messages (doesn't count against rate limits)
  - Still syncs after sending messages to fetch agent responses
  - Manual refresh button still available for on-demand syncing
  - Fixes "api client... exceeds rate limit" errors during initialization and message sending

### Oct 25, 2025 - Enhanced Debug Logging for Message Flow
- **Added comprehensive message flow logging** - Improved debugging visibility for XMTP messaging
  - Added visual separators (‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ) to clearly distinguish message send/receive events in console
  - Message receipts now show "FROM POCKI üéã" vs "FROM YOU" labels for easy identification
  - Added timestamps to all message events for debugging timing issues
  - Text message previews (first 100 chars) logged for quick content verification
  - Transaction messages highlighted with prominent "TRANSACTION MESSAGE RECEIVED!" logs
  - Peer inbox ID validation logged to verify messages sent to correct agent
  - Helps diagnose message delivery issues and agent response timing

### Oct 25, 2025 - 0x AllowanceHolder Transaction Support
- **Added 0x AllowanceHolder swap detection and user guidance** - Improved UX for DEX swap transactions
  - Root cause of "insufficient funds": Pocki AI sends swaps via 0x AllowanceHolder (single-call architecture)
  - Unlike traditional approve + swap (2 calls), AllowanceHolder requires ONE-TIME token approval beforehand
  - If user hasn't approved the token yet, MetaMask gas estimation fails showing misleading errors
  - Added yellow warning banner in TransactionModal detecting AllowanceHolder transactions
  - Warning explains token approval requirement and why MetaMask shows "insufficient funds"
  - Added debug logging to track transaction structure (version, from, chainId, callsCount, calls array)
  - Architecture: AllowanceHolder (`0x0000000000001ff3684f28c67538d4d072c22734`) pulls tokens and routes swaps
  - Note: Works correctly in Base App where users have likely pre-approved AllowanceHolder

### Oct 25, 2025 - RPC Rate Limit Fix (Enhanced v2)
- **Fixed MetaMask RPC rate limiting during multi-call transactions** - Swap transactions now execute reliably
  - Root cause: MetaMask makes 5-10 RPC calls per transaction for gas estimation, balance checks, and simulation
  - Multi-call swaps (approve + swap) create burst of 10-20 requests in seconds, hitting public RPC rate limits
  - **Critical discovery**: MetaMask ignores dApp's RPC config for transaction signing, uses its own saved RPC settings
  - **Solution**: Changed wagmi config to use `custom(window.ethereum)` instead of `fallback(http())` endpoints
  - Now respects whatever RPC user has configured in MetaMask (e.g., Alchemy, QuickNode, etc.)
  - Eliminates need for delays between transactions when user has premium RPC configured
  - Falls back to Alchemy/public RPCs only in non-browser environments (SSR)
  - **User action**: Add Alchemy or premium RPC to MetaMask for instant, reliable swaps
  - Configuration: Settings ‚Üí Networks ‚Üí Base ‚Üí Add RPC URL or use [ChainList](https://chainlist.org/chain/8453)

### Oct 24, 2025 - CRITICAL FIX: Transaction Message Detection
- **Fixed wallet swap transactions not working** - Transaction approval requests now appear correctly
  - Root cause: Code was checking `contentType.typeId` string instead of using XMTP recommended `.sameAs()` method
  - Solution: Import `ContentTypeWalletSendCalls` and use `message.contentType.sameAs(ContentTypeWalletSendCalls)` for detection
  - Updated both streaming and refresh message handlers to use proper XMTP content type comparison
  - Fixes "Filtering out unknown message type: walletSendCalls" console error
  - Transaction requests from Pocki AI now properly trigger the Execute Transaction modal

### Oct 24, 2025 - Landing Page Description Update
- **Updated "What is Pocki?" section** - Refreshed landing page description text
  - New description: "Pocki is your mindful AI onchain wallet companion. Like a wise panda who never rushes, Pocki helps you set alerts, journal your trades, and pause before acting on impulse. Trade with intention on Base."
  - Better emphasizes mindfulness, specific features (alerts, journaling), and Base network focus

### Oct 24, 2025 - Debug Tools Enhancement
- **Added Clear XMTP Database tool** - New debug panel feature to fix stuck XMTP states
  - Button to clear all XMTP IndexedDB databases and reload the page
  - Helps resolve stuck Intent errors and installation conflicts
  - Provides confirmation dialog to warn users before clearing data

### Oct 23, 2025 - XMTP Sync Improvements
- **Enhanced conversation sync strategy** - Improved reliability for message delivery
  - Added post-revocation sync: After revoking old installations, immediately syncs all conversations
  - Added conversation-specific sync: When getting existing conversations, syncs to ensure current group state
  - Fixes inbox validation errors caused by stale group membership data

### Oct 23, 2025 - XMTP Transaction Support (WalletSendCalls)
- **Implemented XMTP WalletSendCalls content type** - Full support for on-chain transaction requests from Pocki AI agent
  - Installed and integrated `@xmtp/content-type-wallet-send-calls` package

  - Updated message handlers to detect and parse transaction messages in both streaming and refresh flows
  - Extended Message interface with `contentType` field ('text' | 'transaction') and `transaction` field for payload
  - Enhanced MessageList component to display transaction requests with visual indicators and "Execute Transaction" button
  - Completely rewrote TransactionModal to support XMTP multi-call format:
    - Sequential execution of multiple calls (e.g., approve + swap flows)
    - Uses `sendTransactionAsync` and `waitForTransactionReceipt` for proper async confirmation
    - Validates `from` address matches connected wallet before execution
    - Validates chain ID (Base network: 8453) before execution
    - Per-call status tracking with distinct UI states: "Signing...", "Confirming...", "‚úÖ Confirmed"
    - Detects and surfaces reverted transactions as errors
    - Graceful error handling with per-call error messages
    - Only shows success banner when all calls are confirmed on-chain
  - Maintains backward compatibility with legacy transaction format
  - Full support for transaction metadata (description, type, amount, currency)
