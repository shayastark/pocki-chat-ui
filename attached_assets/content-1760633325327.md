# Version Staleness

## [Why This Error Occurred](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/version-staleness\#why-this-error-occurred)

In the error overlay, a message was shown that the detected Next.js version was out-of-date.

To get the newest features and bug fixes, it is recommended to stay up to date.

## [Possible Ways to Fix It](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/version-staleness\#possible-ways-to-fix-it)

If you are testing out a canary release, upgrade Next.js with one of the following:

Terminal

```code-block-module__NOThwW__code
npm i next@canary
```

Terminal

```code-block-module__NOThwW__code
yarn add next@canary
```

Terminal

```code-block-module__NOThwW__code
pnpm add next@canary
```

Terminal

```code-block-module__NOThwW__code
bun add next@canary
```

If you are using a stable release, upgrade Next.js with one of the following:

Terminal

```code-block-module__NOThwW__code
npm i next@latest
```

Terminal

```code-block-module__NOThwW__code
yarn add next@latest
```

Terminal

```code-block-module__NOThwW__code
pnpm add next@latest
```

Terminal

```code-block-module__NOThwW__code
bun add next@latest
```

### [Note](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/version-staleness\#note)

If you want to report a bug on GitHub, you should upgrade to the newest canary release of Next.js first, to see if the bug has already been fixed in canary.
