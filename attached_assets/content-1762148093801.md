## Breaking revisions

[Permalink: Breaking revisions](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-js/blob/main/sdks/node-sdk/README.md#breaking-revisions)

Because this SDK is in active development, you should expect breaking revisions that might require you to adopt the latest SDK release to enable your app to continue working as expected.

Breaking revisions in a Node SDK release are described on the [Releases page](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-js/releases).

## Deprecation

[Permalink: Deprecation](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-js/blob/main/sdks/node-sdk/README.md#deprecation)

Older versions of the SDK will eventually be deprecated, which means:

1. The network will not support and eventually actively reject connections from clients using deprecated versions.
2. Bugs will not be fixed in deprecated versions.

The following table provides the deprecation schedule.

| Announced | Effective | Minimum Version | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| No more support for XMTP V2 | May 1, 2025 | >=1.0.5 | In a move toward better security with MLS and the ability to decentralize, we will be shutting down XMTP V2 and moving entirely to XMTP V3. To learn more about V2 deprecation, see [XIP-53: XMTP V2 deprecation plan](https://community.xmtp.org/t/xip-53-xmtp-v2-deprecation-plan/867). To learn how to upgrade, see [@xmtp/node-sdk v1.0.5](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-js/releases/tag/%40xmtp%2Fnode-sdk%401.0.5). |

Bug reports, feature requests, and PRs are welcome in accordance with these [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-js/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
