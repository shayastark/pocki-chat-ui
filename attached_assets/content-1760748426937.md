Use the reaction content type to support reactions with your agent. A reaction is a quick and often emoji-based way to respond to a message. Reactions are usually limited to a predefined set of emojis or symbols provided by the chat app.

## Install the package

In some SDKs, the `ReactionCodec` is already included in the SDK. If not, you can install the package using the following command:

npmyarnpnpm

Terminal

npm

```vocs_Code

npm i @xmtp/content-type-reaction
```

## Configure the content type

After importing the package, you can register the codec.

Node

```vocs_Code

import { ReactionCodec } from '@xmtp/content-type-reaction';
// Create the XMTP agent
const agent = await Agent.create(signer, {
  env: 'dev',
  codecs: [new ReactionCodec()],
});
```

## Send a reaction

With XMTP, reactions are represented as objects with the following keys:

- `reference`: ID of the message being reacted to

- `action`: Action of the reaction (added or removed)

- `content`: String representation of the reaction (smile, for example) to be interpreted by clients

- `schema`: Schema of the reaction (Unicode, shortcode, or custom)


Node

```vocs_Code

await ctx.sendReaction('❤️');
```

## Receive a reaction

Node

```vocs_Code

agent.on('reaction', async (ctx) => {
  const message = ctx.message;
  const reactionContent = message.content;
  console.log(`New reaction: ${reactionContent.content}`);
});
```

## Filter a reaction

Now that you can send a reaction, you need a way to receive a reaction. For example:

Node

```vocs_Code

if (ctx.usesCodec(ReactionCodec)) {
  // We've got a reaction.
  const reaction: Reaction = ctx.message.content;
}
```
