Create a Next.js 14 web application for "Pocki Chat" - an XMTP messaging client to chat with an AI wallet health agent.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Privy authentication: @privy-io/react-auth, @privy-io/wagmi
- XMTP messaging: @xmtp/react-sdk
- Ethereum interactions: wagmi, viem, @tanstack/react-query

PROJECT STRUCTURE:
Set up the following provider hierarchy in the root layout:
1. PrivyProvider (with app ID placeholder for now)
2. QueryClientProvider (TanStack Query)
3. WagmiProvider (using @privy-io/wagmi's createConfig, not wagmi directly)
4. App content

CORE FEATURES TO SCAFFOLD:
1. Landing page (app/page.tsx) with:
   - Pocki branding introduction
   - Privy login button (support wallet + email/social login)
   - Panda-themed design (calm greens, bamboo accents)

2. Chat interface (app/chat/page.tsx) with:
   - Protected route (requires Privy authentication)
   - XMTP client initialization using user's wallet
   - Message list component (displays conversation history)
   - Message input component (send messages)
   - Connection to XMTP agent address: 0xd003c8136e974da7317521ef5866c250f17ad155

3. Transaction handling:
   - Component to display transaction requests from XMTP messages
   - Integration with wagmi to execute Base network transactions
   - Support for ERC-20 token approvals and swaps

DESIGN THEME:
- Panda mascot: üêº (calm, thoughtful, supportive personality)
- Bamboo accent emoji: üéã
- Color palette: soft greens, blacks, whites (panda/bamboo inspired)
- Clean, minimal, calming interface
- Smooth animations (gentle, not jarring)

IMPORTANT TECHNICAL NOTES:
- Import createConfig and WagmiProvider from '@privy-io/wagmi', NOT from 'wagmi'
- Configure wagmi for Base network (chainId: 8453)
- XMTP environment should be 'production'
- Use XMTP React SDK hooks for message streaming and sending
- All wallet operations should use Privy + wagmi

CONFIG PLACEHOLDERS:
- Create .env.example with: NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID, NEXT_PUBLIC_XMTP_ENV
- Add instructions in README for obtaining Privy app ID

Please scaffold the complete file structure with provider setup, routing, and placeholder components ready for implementation.
