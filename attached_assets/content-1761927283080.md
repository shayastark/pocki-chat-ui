**Prerequisites**

- You have an existing web app
- You have a Base app account

1

Add the MiniApp SDK

npm

pnpm

yarn

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
npm install @farcaster/miniapp-sdk

```

2

Trigger App Display

Once your app has loaded, call `sdk.actions.ready()` to hide the loading splash screen and display your app.

- Vanilla JS

- React


app.js

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
import { sdk } from '@farcaster/miniapp-sdk';

// Once app is ready to be displayed
await sdk.actions.ready();

```

3

Host the Manifest

Create a file available at `https://www.your-domain.com/.well-known/farcaster.json`.

- Vanilla JS

- Next.js


Create the manifest file in your project at `/public/.well-known/farcaster.json`.

4

Update the Manifest

Copy the example manifest below and add it to the file created in the previous step. Update each field in the `miniapp`.For details on each field, see the [field reference](https://docs.base.org/mini-apps/features/manifest#field-reference)

### [​](https://docs.base.org/mini-apps/quickstart/migrate-existing-apps\#example-manifest)  Example Manifest

Create accountAssociation Credentials

The `accountAssociation` fields in the manifest are used to verify ownership of your app. You can generate these fields on Base Build.

1. Ensure all changes are live so that the Manifest file is available at your app’s url.
2. Navigate to the Base Build [Account association tool](https://www.base.dev/preview?tab=account).
3. Paste your domain in the `App URL` field (ex: sample-url.vercel.app) and click “Submit”
4. Click on the “Verify” button that appears and follow the instructions to generate the `accountAssociation` fields.
5. Copy the `accountAssociation` fields and paste them into the manifest file you added in the previous step.

}

```

Note: Because you are signing with your Base Account, the `signature` field will be significantly longer than if you were to sign directly with your Farcaster custody wallet.

Add Embed Metadata

Update your index.html file to include the `fc:miniapp` metadata. This is used to generate the rich embeds when your app is shared and is required for your app to display.

- Vanilla JS

- Next.js


Add directly to your index.html file.

index.html

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
  <meta name="fc:miniapp" content='{
  "version":"next",
  "imageUrl":"https://your-app.com/embed-image",
  "button":{
      "title":"Play Now",
      "action":{
      "type":"launch_miniapp",
      "name":"Your App Name",
      "url":"https://your-app.com"
      }
  }
  }' />

```

7

Push to Production

Ensure all changes are live.

8

Preview Your App

Use the Base Build [Preview tool](https://www.base.dev/preview) to validate your app.

1. Add your app URL to view the embeds and click the launch button to verify the app launches as expected.
2. Use the “Account association” tab to verify the association credentials were created correctly.
3. Use the “Metadata” to see the metadata added from the manifest and identify any missing fields.

9

Post to Publish

To publish your app, create a post in the Base app with your app’s URL.![Posting an app to Base app](https://mintcdn.com/base-a060aa97/t8Sjfqig2G4AU7Gh/images/minikit/publish-app-base.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=t8Sjfqig2G4AU7Gh&q=85&s=71a07b27f04a4df65f47fced5b2b76a5)
